# CoPhyML-framework
CoPhyML is a coordinated physics-integrated machine learning framework designed for reliable modeling of complex engineering systems under limited and noise-contaminated data. The framework consists of three components: a knowledge-driven module, a data-driven module, and an integration layer.

# CoPhyML: Coordinated Physics-Integrated Machine Learning Framework
This repository provides the official implementation of **CoPhyML**, a coordinated physics-integrated machine learning framework proposed in our paper:

> *Coordinated Physics-Integrated Machine Learning and Its Application in Tunnel Engineering.*

CoPhyML aims to enable reliable modeling and prediction under limited and noisy engineering data by integrating dimensional analysis, mechanical principles, and data-driven learning.
