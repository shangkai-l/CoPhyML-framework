# CoPhyML: Coordinated Physics-Integrated Machine Learning Framework

CoPhyML is a coordinated physics-integrated machine learning framework designed for reliable modeling of complex engineering systems under limited and noise-contaminated data. The framework consists of three components: a knowledge-driven module, a data-driven module, and an integration layer.

This repository provides the official implementation of **CoPhyML**, a coordinated physics-integrated machine learning framework proposed in our paper:

> *Coordinated Physics-Integrated Machine Learning and Its Application in Tunnel Engineering.*

CoPhyML aims to enable reliable modeling and prediction under limited and noisy engineering data by integrating dimensional analysis, mechanical principles, and data-driven learning.

## 🔍 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main modules:
---

- **Knowledge-driven preprocessing**  
  Implements dimensional analysis and constructs intrinsic, scale-independent π factors.

- **Model learning under limited/noisy data**  
  Integrates physics-informed representations into machine learning pipelines, and the establishment of comparative models.

- **Analysis of results under dataset perturbation**  
  Provide scripts for modeling and computation on perturbed datasets.

- **Display of key calculation output data**  
  Provided the measured-predicted results of CoPhyML-1 and CoPhyML-2, as well as the standard deviation of various methods predicting fluctuations at different test samples under data perturbation.
