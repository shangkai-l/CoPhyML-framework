# CoPhyML-framework
CoPhyML is a coordinated physics-integrated machine learning framework designed for reliable modeling of complex engineering systems under limited and noise-contaminated data. The framework consists of three components: a knowledge-driven module, a data-driven module, and an integration layer.
